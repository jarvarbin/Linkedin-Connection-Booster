# LinkedIn Automation - Connection Booster

A simple JavaScript automation script for boosting your LinkedIn connections by sending multiple connection requests.

## üìò Description

This script, once executed in the context of a LinkedIn page, will automate the process of sending out connection requests. The script ensures you can:
- Click on multiple "Connect" buttons.
- Scroll through the page to find more connections if there aren't enough visible.
- Limit the number of connection requests you send.
- See the logs for successful connections and any failed clicks.

## üåü Features

- **Set a Limit**: Define the maximum number of connections to send.
- **Delay Control**: Define the delay between each connection request and scroll action.
- **Bulk Scrolling**: Enables loading more profiles when needed.
- **Tracking**: Keep track of successful connections and fails.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Navigate to your LinkedIn page or any LinkedIn page containing connection buttons.
2. Open the browser console (Usually, `Ctrl + Shift + J` for Chrome and `Ctrl + Shift + K` for Firefox).
3. Copy the entire script.
4. Paste it in the console and press `Enter`.
5. Watch as the script automates sending connection requests!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

- `LIMIT`: Maximum number of connections to send.
- `SCROLL_TIMEOUT`: Delay between each scroll action.
- `BULK_SCROLL_COUNT`: Number of times to scroll to load new profiles.
- `CLICK_DELAY`: Delay between each "Connect" click.
- `MINIMUM_CONNECTS_TO_CLICK`: Minimum connections visible to start the clicking process.
- `MINIMUM_CONNECTS_TO_SCROLL`: Minimum connections visible before initiating a scroll to load more profiles.

## üìú Logs

You can monitor the script's progress in the console, which logs the number of connections made, failed clicks, and its current action.
